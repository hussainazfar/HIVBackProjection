Figure 6 depicts Probability Of Testing By Year:-

The model estimates that the annual testing probabilty fell to the lowest point (p=0.33 [0.30-0.38]) in 1999, the year which coincides with the lowest number of diagnoses.
Testing probailities are calculated to have increased since then, with the annual testing probability in the final year of data at p=0.41 (0.33-0.54)
